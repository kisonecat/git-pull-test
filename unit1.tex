Another test with the SENDER.

\begin{exercise}
Given that $s(k)=-k^2-4 k+2$, evaluate $s(4.5)$. Express your answer in decimal notation.
\begin{solution}
\begin{hint}
$s(4.5)=-(4.5)^2-4 (4.5)+2$.
\end{hint}
\begin{hint}
$s(4.5)=-36.25$.
\end{hint}
The value of the function $s(k)=-k^2-4 k+2$, evaluated at $k=4.5$, is \answer{-36.25}.
\end{solution}

Here is some text after the first problem.
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
Let's again find a function $f(x)$ so that $f(2) = 4$.

\begin{solution}
\begin{hint}
Try a linear function.
\end{hint}
An example is $f(x) = $ \begin{expression-answer}
  function validator(f) {
    if (f.variables().indexOf('x') == -1) {
      feedback( 'You should include an $x$ in your answer.' );
    }

    if (f.variables().length > 1) {
      feedback( 'The only variable you should use is $x$.' );
    }

    if (abs(f.evaluate( {x:2} ) - 4.0) < 0.0001)
      return 1;

    feedback( 'Check what happens when you plug in $x=2$.' );
    return 0;
  }
\end{expression-answer}.
\end{solution}

That is a great example.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  Here is a multiple choice problem.

  \begin{solution}
    \begin{multiple-choice}
      \choice{Wrong answer A}
      \choice{Wrong answer B}
      \choice{Wrong answer C}
      \choice[correct]{Correct answer D}
    \end{multiple-choice}
  \end{solution}

  Here is some text after the multiple choice.
\end{exercise}
