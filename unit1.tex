\begin{theorem}
A THEOREM is here NOWNOWNOWNOWW!
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[The Main One]
A main THEOREM is right now.
\end{theorem}

\begin{image}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw (0,0) circle (1in);
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw (0,0) -- (1,1);
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{image}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The first thing
\item The second thing
\item The third thing!
\end{enumerate}

Here you \(2x < 5x\) go and so on.

\begin{exercise}
\outcome{Evaluate things}
Given that $s(k)=-k^2-4 k+2$, evaluate $s(4.5)$. Express your answer in decimal notation.
\begin{hint}
$s(4.5)=-(4.5)^2-4 (4.5)+2$.
\end{hint}
\begin{hint}
$s(4.5)=-36.25$.
\end{hint}
The value of the function $s(k)=-k^2-4 k+2$, evaluated at $k=4.5$, is $\answer{-36.25}$.

Here is some text after the first problem.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Here's a given: $y = 1$.

So $y = \answer[given]{1}$.

\begin{feedback}
FEEDBACKED
\end{feedback}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Let's again find a number $y$ so that $3y = 17$.

No, find $y = x^2 + \sqrt{x}$.

\begin{hint}
Try a fraction.
\end{hint}
An example is $y = \answer{x^2 + \sqrt{x}}$.

That is a great example.

\begin{feedback}
Here's some feedback for you.
\end{feedback}
\end{exercise}

Note that \[\lim_{x \to \infty} 5x = \infty.\]

\begin{exercise}
  Here is a multiple choice problem.

    \begin{multipleChoice}
      \choice{Wrong answer A}
      \choice{Wrong answer B}
      \choice{Wrong answer C}
      \choice[correct]{Correct answer D}
    \end{multipleChoice}

  Here is some text after the multiple choice.

  \begin{explanation}
    I'm explaining here.
  \end{explanation}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  Here is an exercise with no answerables.

  \begin{explanation}
    I'm explaining here.
  \end{explanation}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  Here is a multiple select problem.

    \begin{selectAll}
      \choice{Wrong answer A}
      \choice[correct]{Correct answer B}
      \choice{Wrong answer C}
      \choice[correct]{Correct answer D}
    \end{selectAll}

  Here is some text after the multiple choice.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  I choose \wordChoice{\choice{to lose}\choice[correct]{to win}} the game.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
  Here is a \wordChoice{\choice{incorrect}\choice[correct]{right}\choice{left}\choice{wrong}} word.

  And $2x = \answer{2x}$.
\end{exercise}
